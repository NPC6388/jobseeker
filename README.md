### Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
npm run web
```
Opens a private web dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` with:
- üìä Real-time job search monitoring

### Command Line Interface

#### Test Mode (Recommended First)
```bash
npm start
```
This runs in dry-run mode by default - it will search and filter jobs but won't actually apply.

#### Live Mode
Set `DRY_RUN=false` and `AUTO_SUBMIT=true` in your `.env` file, then:
```bash
npm start
```

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
npm run web-dev  # For web interface development
```
Runs with auto-reload when files change.

- ‚úÖ Jobs within your location radius

- ‚ùå Excludes night/weekend shifts
- ‚ùå Excludes travel-heavy positions

## Data Files

The app creates several data files to track your job search:

- `data/applied-jobs.json` - List of jobs you've already applied to
- `data/application-log.json` - Detailed log of all application attempts

## Safety Features

- **Dry Run Mode**: Test the app without actually applying to jobs
- **Daily Limits**: Prevents spam applications
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Tracks applied jobs to avoid reapplying
- **Manual Review**: Option to fill forms but not auto-submit

## Supported Job Boards

- **Indeed**: Full search and application support
- **LinkedIn**: Search support (manual application required due to login requirements)

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use Responsibly**: Only apply to jobs you're genuinely interested in
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Respect Rate Limits**: Don't overwhelm job sites with requests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Review Applications**: Always review auto-filled applications before submitting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Terms of Service**: Ensure compliance with job board terms of service

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No jobs found**: Check your location and keywords in `.env`
2. **Resume not uploading**: Ensure file path is correct and file exists
3. **Applications failing**: Try setting `AUTO_SUBMIT=false` to manually review
4. **LinkedIn not working**: LinkedIn requires manual login - applications will be logged for manual follow-up

### Logs

Check the console output and `data/application-log.json` for detailed information about what happened during each run.
